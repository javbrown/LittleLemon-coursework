# LittleLemon final project

In this final project for the Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate, I used the Django REST Framework to build an API for the Little Lemon restaurant.

I completed exercises, received general instructions and code snippets, and utilized links to resources from previous courses to complete this task.

I demonstrated my web development skills by writing code to create an API that handles table bookings for the Little Lemon restaurant.

The API can receive HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, and updates the Django models, which in turn, updates the data in a MySQL database.

/restaurant/menu
/restaurant/booking
